# Understanding Node.js HTTP Server Code

**Q: Please explain this code. Where are we sending the request and getting or displaying the response? What is POST here? And what happens in a GET, which is the default behavior in Node?**

**A:** Sure, I'll explain the code step by step.

> const http = require("http");
const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {  
  let body = [];  
  request.on("data", (chunk) => {  
    body.push(chunk);  
    console.log(chunk);  
  });  
  request.on("end", () => {  
    body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();  
    console.log(body);    
    let username = "unknown user";  
    if (body) {    
      username = body.split("=")[1];  
    }  
    response.setHeader("Content-type", "text/html");  
    response.write(`<h2>Hi ${username}</h2><form method="POST" action="/"><input name="username" type="text"><button type="submit">SEND</button></form>`);  
    response.end();  
  });  
})  
server.listen(3000);  

In this code:

We are creating an HTTP server using Node.js's built-in http module.
The server listens for incoming requests and responds accordingly.
POST and GET are HTTP methods. POST is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource, and GET requests data from a specified resource.
Q: Here, what is data? Is it the request data sent to the server from the client side?

A: Yes, you are correct. The "data" and "end" events refer to the request body data sent from the client to the server.

Q: In this, the response object is what is sent back from the server side to the client side?

A: Yes, the response object represents the response sent back to the client by the server.

Q: So right now, we are using response.write() to mimic a client-side for learning purposes?

A: Exactly. In this example, response.write() is used to generate an HTML response on the server side for learning purposes. Typically, client-side code (e.g., JavaScript running in the browser) handles rendering the user interface.

Q: In case of a GET request, the client just requests something to be sent as a response from the server side?

A: Yes, in a GET request, the client requests data or a resource from the server, and the server responds by sending back the requested data or resource.
