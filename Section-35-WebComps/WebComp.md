- Yes, you can add event listeners to elements within the Shadow DOM in the constructor of your custom element class. This is a valid approach, and there's no issue with doing it this way.  
- The reason you can add event listeners in the constructor is that the Shadow DOM is initialized when you call this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" }) and set the shadowRoot.innerHTML. At this point, the Shadow DOM and its elements exist, and you can query and manipulate them using this.shadowRoot.querySelector and this.shadowRoot.querySelectorAll.  
- However, it's important to note that while you can add event listeners in the constructor, the custom element itself is not yet connected to the actual DOM at this point. This means that any code that depends on the element being part of the DOM or interacting with the outer DOM should be placed in the connectedCallback lifecycle method instead.  
- The reason for this is that when the constructor of a Web Component is called, the element hasn't been inserted into the DOM yet. At this stage, attempting to append a child element to the component would result in an error because the component itself is not yet part of the DOM.
